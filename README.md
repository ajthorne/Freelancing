FREELANCE
Starting Your Own Web Development Business and Learning How to Survive in the Digital Wild
 
  “We’re naturally ambitious, driven people who take giant leaps many others don’t or won’t. We’re often labeled “risk takers,” “mavericks” and “renegades.” We take bold steps. We understand the potential
    consequences, but we still blaze trails.”
 - Kristen Wright



What are we going to talk about?

1. Business basics 
2. Getting started 
3. Finding, keeping, and managing clients 
4. Providing the highest quality work
 

 <h1>Business basics & Getting started</h1>
   You can stay in bed all day, but you won’t want to.
When you picture your ideal lifestyle:
How do you picture working?
What time of day is it?
What kind of clients do you want to attract? What are you working on?
  ...But why?
Why are you leaving your job?
Why do you want to freelance?
Do you want to have a greater impact? What really inspires you?
 
  <h2>Crafting a schedule</h2>
What are the constants in your week? What do you need to make time for? Schedule everything, even play time. Always leave ample room in between.
  It’s safe to assume that projects will take at least 2 to 3 times longer than you think they will.
  Married to the money... or not.
Do you have as much money as you want; how much do you need to make?
What hangups do you have about money that could prevent you from making as much as you want? What don’t you know?
  What no one talks about
Is your company filed with the state? Do you have a CPA?
Do you have a budget?
Do you have a business account and a savings account for your taxes?
